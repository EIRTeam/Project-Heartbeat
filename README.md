# Building

Currently this branch (godot4 branch) is the latest branch, it's a work-in-progress port of the game to Godot 4.

In order to run the game, you'll need a specially customised version of the godot engine, this can be found [here](https://github.com/eirteam/godot/tree/shinobu_gd4) under the shinobu_gd4 branch. This modification of the engine includes steamworks support, ffmpeg and the new input glyphs system.

 # License

 The current source code release is not open source, it's all rights reserved, but contributions are welcome with CLA. I still haven't decided what license I will use when it inevitably becomes open source.
